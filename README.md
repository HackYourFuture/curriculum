## Module #1 - [CLI/GIT](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CLI-Git)

![CLI/GIT](./assets/cli-git.png)

Welcome to HackYourFuture! In this module we are going to go into two things that are maybe not as fun as building websites like you did in the application process, but are vital to your success as a developer: the command-line interface (CLI) and Git.

The command-line interface is a way for you to give commands to your computer using text rather than clicking, which will be used throughout your developer life. As you may have already guessed, it is much easier for any code you write to talk to the computer via defined commands rather than trying to navigate a user interface meant for humans. In this module we will give you a quick overview how to access the command-line interface and what commands you will use the most.

You'll also be learning Git, which is software that will allow you to save your folders and files in case they accidentally get deleted or end up corrupt. It is the industry standard when talking about version control of your code and we will be using it all the time during the curriculum so that you become familiar with it.

In the following table you can find the module material, week-by-week:

| Week | Topic                                      | Reading Material                                                                   | Assignments                                                                             |

## Module #2 - [JavaScript](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/)

![JavaScript](./assets/javascript.png)

In this module you'll make a start into the wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language JavaScript to do so. You'll learn about the basic building blocks of programming: `loops`, `functions`, `control flow` and more advanced JavaScript specific intricacies. Consider these as the ABC's of programming, without them it's impossible to write working software!

## Module #3 - [Browsers](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers)

![Browsers](./assets/browsers.png)

In **Browsers** you'll learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser. First, you'll learn about how HTML is structured within your browser: we call this the `Document Object Model` (DOM). Once you've gotten the hang of that we'll apply JavaScript to it, in order to manipulate the elements and make our pages more interactive. We call this `DOM manipulation` and it's one of the most interesting things about JavaScript! We will finish off with a group project to already combine everything you have learned into your first web application. Besides the technical part, you'll improve your 'soft skills' as well in the [Presentation module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module). This is a two weeks program that will get you out of your comfort zone. Check the Read.me file for a more detailed explanation and overview.

| Week | Topic                                                             | Reading Material                                                                    | Assignments                                                                              |

## Module #4 - [Using API's](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs)

![UsingAPIs](./assets/usingapis.png)

A big part of being a programmer means moving data from one place to another. It also means working with other people's software. In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs! On top of that you'll also learn how to think differently about how you write your programs. Like in any field, once you've mastered a particular way of doing things you start thinking about how it could be done differently. In the end you will also build a full project by yourself that takes data from publicly available API's to create a web application with substance!

| Week | Topic                                                                           | Reading Material                                                                     | Assignments                                                                               |

## Module #5 - [Node.js](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js)

![Node.js](./assets/nodejs.png)

Any software application consists of at least 2 parts: a frontend, which is what the user sees and interacts with, and a backend. This module will expose you to the wonderful world of backend development, where you learn all about where your data goes once you've pressed that submit button. You'll be writing web servers and learn how to send users the right feedback.

## Module #7 - [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React)

![React.js](./assets/react.png)

In these 4 weeks we will go back to the frontend and learn how to make faster, more modern user interfaces. You'll become more familiar with a frontend technology called [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library written and maintained by Facebook.

It is mainly used to create dynamic user interfaces, changing the data a user sees depending on their input.

In this module you'll learn about how to think about web pages in a radically different way: instead of making separate pages, you'll be making components of pages. Instead of hardcoded content, you'll make structures that can hold different data.

- How to handle `client-side routing`

## Module #8 - [Project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Project)

![Project](./assets/project.png)

In the upcoming 6 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created a full-stack web application and published it to the internet.

Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice. Added to that you'll learn some more cutting-edge technologies that will prepare you for a great start in a modern software company. We will start out with the basics and incrementally add more complexity. This way you'll learn how all the pieces of a RESTful API fit together, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of where the backend stops and the frontend starts.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is just as important, because you need to be able to communicate your ideas and efforts in an easy-to-understand manner.
