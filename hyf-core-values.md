# HYF core values

## Learning
* Our program is about problem solving and learning how to learn.
* Take responsibility for your own learning process, what you put into this program is what you get out.
* Learning how to code is hard. Don't pretend to understand things if you don't, just ask questions. We love questions. 
* Share your knowledge. Share your favourite resources that helped you understand things/make your life easier. 
* Don't compare yourself to your fellow students, compare yourself to who you were yesterday.
* There is a lot of room for struggling/not understanding, there is no room for people who do nothing.

## Community
* Our volunteers teach on their free Sundays, while they could be with their families and friends. Treat them with respect, value their time. 
* You are now part of our community. Think about how you would like to contribute to the community. What do you have to offer? What can you teach us? How can you help HYF or people in the community? 
* Your team (aka your class).  Doing HYF all alone is merely impossible. Help out your team mates, motivate each other, be strict to each other. Find out why you are all here in this room together. As a team you have a responsibility toward us and mostly towards your teachers. Again, value and respect their time. Motivate them when they need it, help them out as well.
* Help us and our teachers improve by giving regular feedback.

## In short, your responsibilities inside HYF:
* Take ownership for your own learning process. 
* Communicate about problems, struggles, or questions you may have. 
* Give us and our teachers feedback on how we can improve.
* We take you seriously, take yourself seriously as well. There's no room in HYF for doing nothing. 
* Respect our volunteers. 
* Be a team, help each other out.
* Work hard, Google and ask questions.
