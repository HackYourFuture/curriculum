# HackYourFuture Curriculum

>Here you can find an overview of the HackYourFuture program. It gives insight in how our program is structured, organized, what you can expect from the modules that we teach and last but not least where we teach and where you can find support during the week. Our half year course is divided into modules that last 3 weeks with exception of the project module that lasts 6 weeks. Below you can find a short listing of the contents and deliverables/learning goals of the different modules. The headers of the different modules link to the actual repositories that are used by teachers to post assignments/reading materials etc. Be aware that some of the modules make use of more than one repository. 

- Are you a new teacher? Take a look [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/i-am-a-new-teacher.md) for some practical tips on how to get started!
- Are you a new student? Take a look [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/i-am-a-new-student.md) to see how to prepare for your first class!

# What do we teach?

## [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS)/[CLI](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/)

> In this module we learn about Html, CSS and the CLI

| Week | Topic | Details |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS/tree/master/Week1)

>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. This module will introduce the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS. We spend time getting you familiar with your text editor and handy developer tools. After this we will focus on responsive web development. Making responsive websites is an important part of front-end programming. You will learn how to make your websites responsive by using media queries using a “mobile first” approach. Last but not least we will spend time practicing some soft skills that we think are important for becoming a good developer. These include: give and receive feedback to your fellow students, presenting and explaining your work.

>The command line (cli, shell) is the interface between you (the user) and the operating system which interprets your commands and allows the computer to respond to your command. In this module two half day sessions are spend to get students familiar with the command line.

## [Node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js)

> In this module we will learn about Node.js.
 
| Week | Topic | Details |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js/tree/master/week1)
| 2 | [Node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js/tree/master/week2)
| 3 | [Node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js/tree/master/week3) |


>Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). For almost any web application, it is essential to have a backend. The backend is a place where we, the developers, can store our data, communicate with users and let the users communicate with us, do smart things like calculations, data processing etc.

There are many languages for this. We might've heard of Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP and the [list goes on](https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/08/18/popular-programming-languages-2016-go/). 

There are two reasons why we at HYF choose Node.JS over others:
1) You already know JavaScript, so it's easier to get started than other languages
2) Node.js is great for making web APIs because it is asynchronous by nature and thus allows for high input/output. By this we mean that it allows many users to make very light requests at the same time.

### **What will we learn?**
- What is Node.js?
- Using Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Using `require` to include modules
- Using `http` to handle http requests and respond
- Using `fs` to read from and write to files.
- Using `process` to read arguments from the CLI
- Using `express` to make a RESTful API

## [Database](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases)

> In this module we will learn about databases using MySQL.

| Week | Topic | Details |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Database](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/tree/master/Week1)
| 2 | [Database Queries](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/tree/master/Week2)
| 3 | [Database design](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/tree/master/Week3) |

>What is a database? A place to store “things”. Could be as simple as a phone book (physical) or as complex as storing all the inventory for Amazon.com. Why use databases? Easier than having data all over the place. Puts the problem of collecting, storing, sorting and searching data in a single place. There are two primary types of database systems - relational and NoSQL. Relational databases have tables that relate to one another and can be “joined” ACID vs BASE

### **Module goals**
By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Entities
- The relational model
- The Structured Query Language (SQL)
- The construction of a database system
- MySQL as an example of a relational database system
- Non-relational data and NoSQL
- MongoDB as an example of a NoSQL database
