## When do we teach?

### Class on Sunday

Class is every Sunday from 12.00 to approximately 16/16.30.

### Online support

During the week students work at home on the given assignments or reading material provided by the teacher. Teachers and mentors are available during the week on Slack to provide support or answer questions related to the given homework.

## How do we teach?

### Modules

At HackYourFuture we teach in modules. The modules can be seen as a three week [sprint](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint) wherein the teachers set clear learning goals for the end of each module. The list of module goals should be used by students to check if they understood all the core concepts of a certain module.

### What do we mean by module goals?

Module goals can be read as: "By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following..."

### Come prepared!

Students are expected to finish all reading material before class, teachers provide students with reading material (mostly on Wednesdays) introducing the concepts that will be discussed in the upcoming session. Students are expected to **always** come prepared to the class on Sunday.

## What tools do we use?

### Github

Our **[Github repository](https://github.com/HackYourFuture)** contains all the specifications and learning goals for the different modules. It's advised to get yourself familiar with [Github](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/).

### Slack

**[Slack](https://slack.com/is)** is used to communicate between teachers and students during the week. Each class has their own channel in Slack where module specific questions can be asked. We require our students to be active on Slack and ask questions when they get stuck. Students are off course also stimulated to help each other out.

### Trello

**[Trello](https://trello.com/tour)** is where students hand in their homework and also receive feedback on their assignments in the first module only. It's a commonly used tool for project management in workspaces and valuable to know your way around it.
