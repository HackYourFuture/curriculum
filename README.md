## Learning goals

If you follow the program you'll learn the following skills:

- Ability to `build a basic modern full-stack web application` (using NodeJS, MySQL and React)
- Get experience with working in teams using `Agile principles`
- Knowing how to `learn and self-teach new programming concepts`
- How to use `third-party libraries/APIs`
- Have a basic understanding of what it means to work on digital products

## Module #1 - [HTML/CSS/GIT](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS)

![HTML/CSS](./assets/html-css.png)

Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice.

The products of HTML and CSS comprise two-thirds of what is called `frontend` (the final third is client-side JavaScript, which you will learn about in later modules). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website.

Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing!

You'll also be learning [GIT](https://www.github.com/hackyourfuture/git), software that will allow you to save your folders and files in case they accidentally get deleted or end up corrupt. It can do much more and you'll learn all about that starting from week 2!

In the following table you can find the module material, week-by-week:

## Module #3 - [Browsers](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers)

![Browsers](./assets/browsers.png)

In **Browsers** you'll learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser. First, you'll learn about how HTML is structured within your browser: we call this the `Document Object Model` (DOM). Once you've gotten the hang of that we'll apply JavaScript to it, in order to manipulate the elements and make our pages more interactive. We call this `DOM manipulation` and it's one of the most interesting things about JavaScript! We will finish off with a group project to already combine everything you have learned into your first web application. Besides the technical part, you'll improve your 'soft skills' as well in the [Presentation module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module). This is a two weeks program that will get you out of your comfort zone. Check the Read.me file for a more detailed explanation and overview. 

| Week | Topic | Reading Materials | Homework |

- Be able to present your ideas in a professional setting

## Module #4 - [Using API's](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs)

![JavaScript3](./assets/usingapis.png)

A big part of being a programmer means moving data from one place to another. It also means working with other people's software. In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs! On top of that you'll also learn how to think differently about how you write your programs. Like in any field, once you've mastered a particular way of doing things you start thinking about how it could be done differently. In the end you will also build a full project by yourself that takes data from publicly available API's to create a web application with substance!

## Module #5 - [Node.js](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js)

![Node.js](./assets/nodejs.png)

Any software application consists of at least 2 parts: a frontend, which is what the user sees and interacts with, and a backend. This module will expose you to the wonderful world of backend development, where you learn all about where your data goes once you've pressed that submit button. You'll be writing web servers and learn how to send users the right feedback.

## Module #7 - [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React)

![React.js](./assets/react.png)

In these 4 weeks we will go back to the frontend and learn how to make faster, more modern user interfaces. You'll become more familiar with a frontend technology called [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library written and maintained by Facebook.

It is mainly used to create dynamic user interfaces, changing the data a user sees depending on their input.

In this module you'll learn about how to think about web pages in a radically different way: instead of making separate pages, you'll be making components of pages. Instead of hardcoded content, you'll make structures that can hold different data.

- Be able to work with different `lifecycle hooks`
- Distinguish between `class-based versus function-based components`
- Recognize the utility of `modularization`
- Putting emphasis on writing reusable code (`components`)
- How to handle `client-side routing`

## Module #8 - [Project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Project)

![Project](./assets/project.png)

In the upcoming 7 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created a full-stack web application and published it to the internet.

Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice. Added to that you'll learn some more cutting-edge technologies that will prepare you for a great start in a modern software company. We will start out with the basics and incrementally add more complexity. This way you'll learn how all the pieces of a RESTful API fit together, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of where the backend stops and the frontend starts.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is just as important, because you need to be able to communicate your ideas and efforts in an easy-to-understand manner.
