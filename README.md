# HackYourFuture Curriculum

> Here you can find an overview of the HackYourFuture program. It gives insight in how our program is structured, organized, what you can expect from the modules that we teach and last but not least where we teach and where you can find support during the week. Our half year course is divided into modules that last 3 weeks with exception of the project module that lasts 6 weeks. Below you can find a short listing of the contents and deliverables/learning goals of the different modules. The headers of the different modules link to the actual repositories that are used by teachers to post assignments/reading materials etc. Be aware that some of the modules make use of more than one repository.

## Learning goals

If you follow the program you'll learn the following skills:

- Ability to build a basic modern full-stack web application (using NodeJS, MySQL and React)
- Get experience with working in teams using Agile principles
- Knowing how to learn and self-teach new programming concepts
- How to use third-party libraries/APIs
- Have a basic understanding of what it means to work on digital products

## Module #1 - [HTML/CSS/GIT](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS)

![HTML/CSS](./assets/html-css.png)

Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice.

The products of HTML and CSS comprise a two-thirds of what is called `frontend` (the final third is client-side JavaScript, which you will learn about in later modules). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website.

Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing!

You'll also be learning [GIT](https//www.github.com/hackyourfuture/git), software that will allow you to save your folders and files in case they accidentally get deleted or end up corrupt. It can do much more and you'll learn all about that starting from week 2!

In the following table you can find the module material, week-by-week:

## Module #3 - [JavaScript2](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript2)

![JavaScript2](./assets/javascript2.png)

In **JavaScript2** you'll learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser. First, you'll learn about how HTML is structured within your browser: we call this the `Document Object Model` (DOM). Once you've gotten the hang of that we'll apply JavaScript to it, in order to manipulate the elements and make our pages more interactive. We call this `DOM manipulation` and it's one of the most interesting things about JavaScript!

- Understand what the `Document Object Model` (DOM) is
- Use the basics of `DOM Manipulation`
- Differentiate between `synchronous` and `asynchronous` operations
- Gain awareness of the inner workings of JavaScript
- Learn to think based on principles, instead of libraries and frameworks

## Module #4 - [JavaScript3](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript3)

![JavaScript3](./assets/javascript3.png)

A big part of being a programmer means moving data from one place to another. It also means working with other people's software. In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs!

On top of that you'll also learn how to think differently about how you write your programs. Like in any field, once you've mastered a particular way of doing things you start thinking about how it could be done differently. In programming we call these `paradigms` and in this module you'll learn one such paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming!

## Module #5 - [Node.js](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js)

![Node.js](./assets/nodejs.png)

Any software application consists of at least 2 parts: a frontend, which is what the user sees and interacts with, and a backend. This module will expose you to the wonderful world of backend development, where you learn all about where your data goes once you've pressed that submit button. You'll be writing web servers and learn how to send users the right feedback.

## Module #7 - [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React)

![React.js](./assets/react.png)

In these 5 weeks we will go back to the frontend and learn how to make faster, more modern user interfaces. You'll become more familiar with a frontend technology called [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library written and maintained by Facebook.

It is mainly used to create dynamic user interfaces, changing the data a user sees depending on their input.

In this module you'll learn about how to think about webpages in a radically different way: instead of making seperate pages, you'll be making components of pages. Instead of hardcoded content, you'll make structures that can hold different data.

### **Module goals**

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Understand the React way of thinking about `user interfaces`
- Know the importance and place of `state` and how to pass it down
- Be able to work with different `lifecycle hooks`
- Distinguish between `class-based versus function-based components`
- Recognize the utility of `modularization`
- Putting emphasis on writing reusable code (`components`)
- How to handle `client-side routing`

## Module #8 - [Project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Project)

![Project](./assets/project.png)

In the upcoming 7 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created a full-stack web application and published it to the internet.

Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice. Added to that you'll learn some more cutting-edge technologies that will prepare you for a great start in a modern software company. We will start out with the basics and incrementally add more complexity. This way you'll learn how all the pieces of a RESTful API fit together, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of where the backend stops and frontend starts.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is just as important, because you need to be able to communicate your ideas and efforts in an easy-to-understand manner.

| Week # | Topic                                  |

| 1.     | Introducing Project, Build the backend |
| 2.     | Build the frontend                     |
| 3.     | Bring everything together              |
| 4.     | Presentation, Discuss Features         |
| 5.     | Group: Working on features I           |
| 6.     | Group: Working on features II          |
| 7.     | Final Presentation                     |

### **Module goals**:

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to work with `GIT in a team setting`
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
- How to work in a `Agile setting`
