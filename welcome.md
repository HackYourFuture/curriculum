# Welcome to HackYourFuture!

![IntroVideo](./assets/intovideo.gif)

Congratulations for being accepted into our program! You should be proud of yourself. We are!

HackYourFuture is completely aimed at making you into a professional web-developer. With a team of more than 60 professional mentors, who are all web-developers, we will teach you everything you need to know about web-development. During our course you will be building your own website, learn how to work in a team, and you will get additional support from other professionals to prepare you for the Dutch labor market. Around 30 cohorts have already graduated, and over 150 people have already found work or internships at great companies like Ebay, Accenture and KLM.

## A few important things:

- Be sure to check your email for the date, time and important details for the introduction session and your starting day.
- Please read our (complete) study manual to be better prepared. You can find the manual [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/student-manual.md).
- Take a quick look at our curriculum already. Get familiar with it's structure and content. You can find it [here](http://www.github.com/hackyourfuture/curriculum).
- Read about HackYourFuture's culture [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/culture).
- Most of our activities are conducted online. However, since March 2020 (start of the Corona pandemic) we have been testing and fine tuning our online sessions and we are quite confident we will provide you with a high quality education experience.
- If you do not have a good working laptop, we can provide you with one that you can use as long as you are a trainee within our program. Please contact Tjebbe in case you need one (you can find his e-mail in the cc of the e-mail you received).
